# Discord Forum Bot - What's New

## 🎉 Version 1.2.0 - June 21, 2025

### ✨ **No More Spam!** 
**Fixed the annoying duplicate notifications!** You'll now only get **one message** when your player ID is mentioned in a forum thread, instead of multiple messages flooding your DMs.

### 📬 **Better Notifications**
- **Cleaner Messages**: When multiple of your player IDs are found in the same thread, you'll get one organized message showing all of them
- **Same Great Features**: You still get notified instantly when someone mentions your IDs in German or Polish forums
- **Rich Embeds**: Discord notifications still look beautiful with colors and formatting

### 🔧 **What We Fixed**
- ❌ **Before**: Getting 2-3 duplicate messages for the same forum post
- ✅ **Now**: One clean, organized notification per forum thread
- ✅ **Telegram**: Also fixed for users who get notifications via Telegram

### 🚀 **Improved Reliability**
- **Better Performance**: Bot runs more smoothly and efficiently
- **Stable Database**: Your player IDs and settings are stored more reliably
- **Cross-Platform**: Works perfectly on all hosting services

### 💬 **User Experience**
- **Less Clutter**: Your DMs stay clean and organized
- **Same Speed**: You still get notified instantly when mentioned
- **All Commands Work**: `/listids`, `/delid`, and other commands work perfectly
- **Privacy**: Notifications are still private (ephemeral messages)
